# Hello! I'm Jeremy ðŸš€

I'm currently studying Computer Science at **UC Berkeley** and **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)**.  

I love exploring how technology shapes the world and enjoy tackling challenging problems across software and systems

Beyond code, you'll probably find me **hiking**, **travelling**, or **cooking something new**.  
I believe in Jesus, and that faith gives meaning and grounding to everything I do.
